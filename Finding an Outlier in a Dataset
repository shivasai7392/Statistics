An outlier is a datapoint that from from the noramal range of an element(that lies outside of the overall distribution of the dataset)

Techniques 

1.Z-score
2.Inter Quantile range(IQR)

Z-score

z=Xi - Mean
 __________
 
 standard_deviation
 
 if z>3 Then Xi datapoint as the outlier
 
 
 Inter Quantile Range(IQR)
 
 steps:
 
 1.Arrange the data in increasing order
 2.calculate first(q1) and third quantile(q3)
 3.Find interquantile range(q3-q1) Known as H-spread(step = H-spread * 1.5)
 4.Find lower bound q1 - step
 5.Find upper bound q3 + step
 
 Anything that lies outside of lower and upper bound is an outlier
